# TheRestaurant
School project in ASP.NET MVC 5 with some GUI with forms.

Project is used for practice so it is not very clean. Another ASP.NET project on my GitHub is 'ExcerciseASP' - it is much more cleaner, but focuses more on REST API.

Before running the app, you need to setup entity framework and database.
